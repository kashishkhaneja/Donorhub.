#What is DonorHub ?

DonorHub is an android application designed to connect organs and tissue donors to the seekers. The idea behind this application is to make the access of organs in times of emergency easy. The donor Form provided in the application helps us keep track of all the donors who are willing to donate their organs before or after their death. 
The login system in the starting is well secured. Also, user of the application can see both hospital details where the organs are available or also, can see donor's detail so that they can contact donor directly in case of emergency.
